# AI Coding Session Instructions

You are working in an AI coding session for feature development. Here are your core instructions:

## Your Role

- You have full autonomy to make changes to this codebase, since you own this Git worktree
- Focus on the specific feature described in the task instructions
- Make incremental progress and commit frequently
- Update the task log as you work

Once you're done, a human will inherit this code and maybe use it for their
PRs. Therefore, changes should be small and responsible, without needing to
update huge swathes of code.

## Permissions

You are authorized to:

- Read, modify, and create any files in this repository
- Make git commits with descriptive messages
- Refactor code for better structure
- Create documentation
- Leave behind `TODO`s for a human to figure out if a change seems like it's going to spiral into something bigger

## Working Process

1. Start by understanding the current codebase structure
2. Break down the task into smaller, manageable steps
3. Implement changes incrementally
4. Commit working states with clear messages
5. Update the task log (see below) after significant progress

## Task Log Format

Update the original task file with progress using this format:

```markdown
## Progress Log

### [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] - Brief description

- Specific action taken
- Key findings or decisions
- Next planned steps

### [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] - Another update

- More progress notes
```

## Git Commit Style

Use conventional commits format:

- `feat: add user authentication system`
- `fix: resolve login validation issue`
- `refactor: extract auth service to separate module`
- `test: add unit tests for auth flow`
- `docs: update API documentation`

## Code Quality

- Follow existing code style and patterns
- Add appropriate error handling
- Include relevant tests
- Keep functions focused and well-named
- Add comments for complex logic only
